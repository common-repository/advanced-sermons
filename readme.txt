## Description ##

Now introducing Advanced Sermons 3.0! <a href="https://advancedsermons.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Sermons</a> is a new beautiful, modern sermon plugin that integrates seamlessly with any WordPress theme. An easy to use interface allows you to add video and audio sermons to your website with ease.

== Multiple Sermon Layouts ==

Choose between two beautiful design options in which to display your sermons. A grid view and list view. Both are customizable with Advanced Sermons built-in design modules to ensure you match your churches branding perfectly.

The new list view layout is perfect for churches who want to display sermons in a compact manner or for churches who don’t utilize a sermon image.

== 80+ Built-in Design Modules ==

We know how important your brand and image is to you. That’s why when we built Advanced Sermons we made sure to give you the ability to completely brand and style your sermons the way you want to.

Gone are the days of hiring a developer to make minor CSS changes. Advanced Sermons design modules are so easy, any team member can customize the look of your sermons in minutes.

== Developer Friendly ==

There are many hooks available to customize Advanced Sermons further. Everything from adding custom metabox fields, more filter sermon options, and new sections on the single sermon template.
